\arguments{
  \item{scLearn_model_learning_result}{
  The result calculated by function "scLearn_model_learning".
}
  \item{expression_profile_query}{
  A dataframe showing the query expression profile. The row is gene and The column is sample.
}
  \item{vote_rate}{
  For 10 times bootstrappings, the percentage of 10 results that has the same assigned cell type. Default is 0.6. If you want a less strict assignment result for "unassigned", you can set it smaller, such as 0.5.
}
  \item{diff}{
  For similar cell types, it is hard to distinguish. If a query cell, if its similarity value to different cell types is too close, then it will be assigned as "unassigned". Default is 0.05. If you want a less strict assignment result for "unassigned", you can set it smaller,such as 0.01.
}
  \item{threshold_use}{
   Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the calculated thresholds to determine "unassigned" cells were used. If FALSE, the calculated thresholds to determine "unassigned" cells were not used, you will get a weak strict result. 
  
}
}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns: "predicted cell type" and "sample name".
